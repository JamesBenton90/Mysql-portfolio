# 📊 Northwind Database Analysis: Skillset Summary
Welcome to my data exploration journey with the Northwind database! Using solid SQL foundations and classic querying techniques, I’ve dissected customer behavior, order details, and product sales to extract meaningful insights. Here’s a summary of the core skills and methods I employed:

🔍 Data Retrieval & Exploration
Mastered SELECT queries to retrieve comprehensive data sets from tables like Customers, Orders, and Products.

Used DESCRIBE statements to understand table structures — a classic move to respect the schema before diving in.

🔗 Joins — The Backbone of Relational Data
Applied all major types of JOINs to correlate data across tables:

INNER JOIN for finding related data only

LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to uncover unmatched records (important for spotting gaps or missing relationships)

CROSS JOIN to generate combinations, useful for exhaustive comparisons

This skill lets you connect the dots across entities like customers, orders, employees, and shippers.

📊 Aggregations & Grouping
Leveraged GROUP BY with COUNT, SUM, and DISTINCT to aggregate data by customer location, product category, and more.

Traditional grouping reveals distribution patterns and volume, like how many orders each shipper handles or sales by product.

📈 Sorting & Filtering
Employed ORDER BY to prioritize data, such as listing customers alphabetically or ranking products by total sales — a key step in making reports clear and insightful.

Used LIMIT to zoom in on the smallest or largest values, maintaining focus on meaningful data points.

🛠️ Real-World Business Queries
Tracked employee performance by counting orders handled, connecting people to outcomes.

Identified products with no orders, helping flag inventory issues or market gaps.

Analyzed customer distribution by country and city, reflecting traditional market segmentation principles.
